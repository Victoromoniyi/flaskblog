Flask
Python
MySQL
Flask-WTF:
- Pillow: Adds functionality to the images making it easier to manipulate them
- BCrypt: Used this to hash the passwords so that the raw passwords aren't stored.
- Bootstrap: I used 2 bootstrap libraries to modify the layout. At first, I just used one but I accidentally found out that by using 2 it modifies the layout in a nice way. Is this unconventional? Probably, I'm not entirely too sure but I didn't want to change it either way. (If
you wanna see what I mean, remove one of the bootstrap links in the layout.html)
- Itsdangerous: Used to create a time sensitive token. I think this is installed with Flask.
- FontAwesome: I used this CDN library for some images on some of the buttons.
